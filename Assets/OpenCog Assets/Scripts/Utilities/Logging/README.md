* Purpose: To assist with logging (especially in creating the highly detailed OCLogger log which contains much more information than we would like to push to the unity play screen.  

* Notes: It may be sensible to include any error logging/exception-throwing classes in here. 

* Refactoring TODO:
    [ ] Establish if any refactoring is to be done.
