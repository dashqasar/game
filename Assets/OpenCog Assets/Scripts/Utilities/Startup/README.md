# Utilities.Startup

* Purpose: This is the current resting space of scripts that load in the configuration arguments and variables for the game world, or are otherwise concerned with startup. It is possible there is a more sensible place for these scripts, such as the Master folder, but as for now they are being kept here. 

* Refactoring TODO:
    [ ] Establish if any refactoring is to be done.
