# Utilities.Structures

* Purpose: Finished/Finalized classes that are used primarily for storing data and performing simple operations on that data. Examples include Maps, Vectors, etc. In C these would often be structs instead of classes.  

* Refactoring TODO:
    [ ] Establish if any refactoring is to be done.
