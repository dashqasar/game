Utilities.Physics

* Purpose: From collision detection to ray tracing, these utility scripts interact frequently with the world and its entities but do not really belong on any one class. Yet. Technically speaking we could probably refactor them to. 

* Notes: It may be sensible to include any error logging/exception-throwing classes in here. 

* Refactoring TODO:
    [ ] Establish if any refactoring is to be done.
