Interfaces.MainMenu

* Purpose: Creates the Main Menu currently

* Notes: Currently we have been running the game directly from the desired scene and not running things through the in-game main menu. It is possible then that we could end up accidentally breaking the menu without realizing it. It is not entirely clear if we even need it. At the same time, it is also nice to leave some polish in the game... At this point, it is currently still fully operational.
