# Interfaces.Console

* Purpose: This folder contains the in-game console that allows us to load the game's avatars and so forth, as well as a sub-directory for each of the commands. 

* Notes: This folder also contains a number of additional elements like the ConsolSkin.guiskin and consola.ttf, which may not really belong here.

* Refactoring TODO:
    [ ] Should some of these filetypes (ie guiskin, ttf) really be here?
	[ ] Many of the Commands do not behave as advertised and are not fully implemented. Is there a way to implement them quickly to avoid confusion in the future, or should we strip them down?
