# Effects

* Purpose: Animations and other affects that can happen to the blocks of the world which do not necessarily belong On the block class or fit into any other category

* Note: It may be possible for this functionality to be subsumed into another location (such as the block class). For now, however, this is an ideal place to store it. Effects was previously stored under rendering, but as they can also achieve data and not just visual goals they have been bumped up a folder.
