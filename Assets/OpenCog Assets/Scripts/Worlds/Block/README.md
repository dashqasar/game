# World.Block

* Purpose: Divided into information about block behavior and the rules for creating their meshes, Block is a parent folder that helps define the various blocks used in the voxel engine. At present, there is a matching BlockType for each MeshType. 

* Notes: This folder may still be useful after the Cubiquity implementation by providing information about what sorts of blocks should have what parameters ie: collision meshes, etc.
