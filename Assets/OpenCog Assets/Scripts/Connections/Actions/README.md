# Actions

* Purpose: These classes are related to the action planner and not only help control the robot's possible gameplay behaviors but also provide those behaviors for communication to the OpenCog side. 

* Notes: This folder may be more at home under the Gameplay parent in the future; that is yet to be decided.
