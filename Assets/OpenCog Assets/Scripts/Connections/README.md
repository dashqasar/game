# Connections

* Purpose: This parent folder houses scripts specific to the OpenCog/Embodiment side of things. It deals with the network, informing OpenCog elements of in-game possible actions, and getting the avatar up and running with all its goals and dreams displayed appropriately. 

* Notes: 'Actions' could in theory belong to the Gameplay high level parent folder, but because it is tied so heavily to the planner, we are currently keeping it in Connections. This may be changed at a later time.
