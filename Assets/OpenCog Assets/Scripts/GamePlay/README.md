# Gameplay

* Purpose: Contains scripts for gameplay, narrative, quests, or whatever it is in the game world that deals entirely with gameplay

* Notes: This folder is underpopulated. Owed to how actions are set up (as having a strong bond with other parts of OpenCog) and how entities and blocks often retain their own properties/colliders/etc in Unity, this folder has been left with a bit of a scarcity of scripts to own. As such, it is to be used as something of a storage facility for odd gameplay related scripts that honestly just don't seem to belong anywhere else or exist at a midway point between the environment and the characters. For example, the Utilities.Physics folder could possibly be moved into Gameplay
